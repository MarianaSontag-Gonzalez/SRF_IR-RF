## Content

This dataset contains the necessary input data and R code to analyse a
spectroscopic luminescence measurement including (i) three methods for
wavelength calibration, (ii) determining a spectral response function
(SRF) from datasheets or from measurements of a reference lamp and (iii)
application of the spectral response function to example measurements of
infra-red radiofluorescence of potassium feldspar made on a *lexsyg
research* device (Freiberg Instruments).

## Requirements

-   **R** programming language
-   **R** packages *Luminescence*, *data.table*, *dplyr*

## Financial support

MSG and MF are supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG FU
417/36-1). The preliminary work by DM and SK was supported by a ZIM-KOOP
Cooperation grant to the Justus Liebig University Giessen and Freiberg
Instruments (grant-No.’s: KF3073002 DF3 & KF3072502 DF3). The LaScArBx
supported the initial work of SK before 2020. LaScArBx is a research
programme supported by the ANR (ANR-10-LABX-52). In the submission
phase, SK received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant
agreement No. 844457 (CREDit).
